   <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>

<div class="line"></div>

<div class="background-color: lightblue;">


   <p>As a curious financial and management accountant with little experience in banking, the innovative trends in the financial world and other non-financial sectors towards data management has birthed my interest for coding. Over the years, the bright information technology ideas invented by coders have transformed the way organizations manage data. One great innovation is the Smart Contract tha allows different parties to a contract to execute business deals without need of physical contact. And another innovation, blockchain, is probably a breakthrough innovation to the world. I have interest in how technology affects the world of finance and data management</p>
   <p>Coding looks so serious I guess, but I read somewhere that <em>"programmers are also humans".</em>That's why I also have hobbies. I like travelling, speaking, and playing strategic mind games like Chess, Scrabble and Monopoly. By the way, try me in Chess or Scrabble and I will carry the trophy home.</p>
   <p>Well, you might ask how I learnt about Moringa. The word is out there that <strong>"Moringa School"</strong> is a top rated school for coders</p>

        <p>Here is a link to my <a href="Myfirst-webpage.html">Myfirst-webpage</a>.</p>
        <p>Myfirst-webpage.html was my first coding exercise I did with a partner. We faced a number of challenges entering the correct codes on the terminal thus we went back and forth making correctios. We used HTML in the exercise.</p>
     <li>favourite-things</li>
        <p>Here is a link to my <a href="favorite-things.html">favorite things</a>.</p>
        <p>This was a good html site. We learnt to link one html site to another. We faced a challenge includig an image but I later learnt how to do it.</p>
  </ol>

</p>
<p>I have learnt a lot of things since I joined Moringa School. Although it is not quite easy to cordinate the coding resources to make a good code. I thank the teachers in advance because <p>I AM GOING TO BECOME A VERY GOOD CODER</em></p>
